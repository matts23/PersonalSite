What does it mean when we say that a website is “static” or “dynamic”? What would be the implications of choosing one type over the other? How can we best choose which path is best for our use case?

<br>

Due to the constant evolution of web technology, the lines are becoming increasingly blurred between what is truly dynamic or static. The traditional definition would say that a dynamic website is built to be in constant contact with a database. This database along with all of its supporting infrastructure is what is often referred to as the “back end” of a website. The user would interact with this database through the website in order to search and view new content. An online store or a social media platform would be considered dynamic.

A static website on the other hand is not built to directly depend on a database in order to change or update its content. A static site is often a case of “what you see is what you get”. Static content and files are what a person can visibly see on the phone or computer when visiting a site. A simple brochure style website for a restaurant could be considered static since all of the content on the site would be expected to stay the same for every person that visits the site. A user cannot interact with a database through something like a form or logging into an account.

For many people and businesses, a static website could be the right decision for many reasons.

<br>

1. The lack of up keeping a database drastically reduces costs to host a website at all levels of scale. In many cases, hosting a static site can be virtually free.

<br>

2. Static sites are fast. Since the site doesn’t have to wait on a response from a separate database,  all the content that the user can view and interact with is already there.

<br>

3. They are secure. With no true “back end” to hack into, static sites offer a peace of mind to the owner knowing that their content is safe from tampering.

<br>

But there are also reasons you may not want to choose a static site

<br>

1. Any time you need to update a website quickly and consistently, a dynamic site may be a better choice.

<br>

2. Creating features such as user authentication, maintaining information such as items in an online store, as well as letting users make purchases.

<br>

3. Giving users the ability to add content to a site, such as posting photos or text.

However, new developments in the web development industry have led to the creation of a new website paradigm known as serverless architecture. This new concept has added a new sense of modularity when it comes to web design.  A static website can be built with all the mentioned benefits, but can also have features that were unique to dynamic sites before added in as well.
